# কোথায় আছে আমার Alumni?

This directory compiles profiles of ex-Nazrulian professionals from the CSE department. The core purpose of this program is to bridge the communication gap between professionals and current students.

## Acknowledgements

This directory is maintained by [Shahriar Hasnat Shafin Ahmed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shafkun/) from batch-16. Special thanks to [S.M. Nadim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smnadim21/) bhai from batch-08 for providing the idea.

## Why this directory is initiated?

This directory is initiated-

- To help freshers by making their job-hunting period a bit more fluent.
- To help current students in finding their senior professionals.
- To help professionals by giving them the oppurtunity of expanding their networks.

Some tips on making the best out of this directory:

- Expand your connection via LinkedIn.
- If you are to give an interview in a company look if any Nazrulians belong to that company and connect with them if you need.
- CV review, interview preparation tips, and company FAQs are some of the basic support you can receive from our seniors.

## Some rules and regulations to follow

As you deal with professionals you have to maintain some rules:

- Treat them with respect. Don't expect them to reply to you instantly. They have a professional life and personal life going on.
- Use either Bangla or English. Don't use Banglish. Try to communicate formally.
- While asking for help try to be more descriptive and to the point.
- Don't Irritate them with questions that can be answered by a simple Google search.

## How to contribute

Any Nazrulian from CSE department can contribute to enrich this directory. All you have to do is share this form with an Nazrulian professional who isn't listed here.
